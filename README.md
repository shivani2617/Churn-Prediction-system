# Churn-Prediction-system
for a telecom company

This is a Churn Prediction system which uses a fictious telecom company data for working. The dataset contains 7043 customers data with 20 potential predictors. The data are available in one data file with 7043 rows that combines the calibration and validation customers. “calibration” database consisting of 4000 customers and a “validation” database consisting of 3043 customers.
Following modules are implemented :-
1. Data cleaning including missing values and multi-collinearity.
2. Data visualization
3. Data prediction model using logistic regression

The accuracy obtained is 0.8091779465170023

I did not only find out which customers are likely to churn, but also which features have the most impact on a customer leaving. So maybe discuss with the customer, so that you can get insight about their needs and can make the model which will be totally different evaluating their predictors. And to retain the customer you should talk to them (who will likely churn) so that you can improve later on.
